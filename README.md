# dask-taxi-fare-prediction
A scalable machine learning pipeline for predicting NYC taxi fares using Dask for big data processing and modeling. This project analyzes 12+ million taxi trips from March 2016 to build an accurate fare prediction model that explains 93.66% of fare variance while efficiently handling large-scale datasets.
